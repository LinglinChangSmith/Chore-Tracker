# Chore-Tracker
Track the date of the chores that you need to do regularly so you do not have to

When was the last time I changed the bed sheets?
When was the last time I mopped the floor?
When was the last time I scrubbed the tubs?
When was the last time I watered the plants?

Well, this app will help you remember.
After you log your chores, you can see the name, frequency, and date of the chores on the front page.
Click "update" to update the date of the chores you just completed.
Click "delete" to remove chores from your chore list.
